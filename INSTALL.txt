INSTALLATION
	
	there is an installer in \install\ try it first by creating your website,
	copying the application files there, and browsing to http://yournewznabserver/install.
	
	refer to the list of requirements above if you encounter any errors during install, or the FAQ in the README
	
	once installed activate only one or two groups to test with first (a.b.teevee is a good choice), this
	will save you time if it is not working correctly.
	
	run the update_binaries.php and update_releases.php scripts in \misc\update_scripts\ via command-line.
	
	if updating was successful then you can continue to setup your site and configure the update scripts for
	auto-updating.

IIS Instructions
	Because nnplus was originally intended to be ran on XAMP/Apache, first import the .htaccess file in the main 
	/www folder to IIS rewrite rules (start IIS -> site name -> URL Rewrite -> Import Rules -> Select .htaccess
	under "Configuration File" and hit import, then apply. This ensures all db related URL strings will bring up
	the appropriate site destinations.
	
	In addition, like all IIS sites, ensure the IIS AppPool\sitename has read/write access to the www/lib/smart/templates_c folder.
	
	Create a new folder in /www called nzbfiles and apply IIS AppPool\sitename read/write to it.
	Create a new folder in /www/nzbfiles called tmpunrar and apply IIS AppPool\sitename read/write to it.
	
RUNNING OUTSIDE OF WEB ROOT
	set /.htaccess RewriteBase to your virtual directory
	
	
SAMPLE APACHE VHOST CONFIG
	add this to your existing VHOST file modifying your values for ServerName, Server Alias, and DocumentRoot.  
	You should find this under /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ (000-default).	
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	        <Directory /domains/www/example.com/newz/www/>
	                Options FollowSymLinks

	                Order allow,deny
